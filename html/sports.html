                <h1 class="primary center">BADMINTON</h1>
                <p class="center">Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
                    Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with
                    one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a
                    casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor
                    court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the
                    opposing side's half of the court.

                    Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
                    shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in
                    their absence) the opposing side.[1]

                    The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently
                    from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag,
                    causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared
                    to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive
                    nature.

                    The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European
                    play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent
                    competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four
                    events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles
                    added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require
                    aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring
                    good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.

                <h1 class="primary center">FOOTBALL</h1>
                <p class="center">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball
                    to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most
                    popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known
                    as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian
                    football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and
                    Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are
                    known as football codes.

                    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
                    different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
                    codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion
                    and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of
                    British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century,
                    distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
                    incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8]
                    In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional
                    football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
                    become some of the most popular team sports in the world

                <h1 class="primary center">CRICKET</h1>
                <p class="center">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field
                    at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two
                    bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the
                    wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to
                    prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket)
                    and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball
                    hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it
                    is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter
                    can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends
                    and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match
                    referee in international matches.

                    The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread
                    globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the
                    second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council
                    (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The
                    game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The
                    sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern
                    Africa and the West Indies. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia,
                    which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other
                    country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.

                <h1 class="primary center">ZUMBA & DANCE</h1>
                <p class="center">Zumba is a total-body cardio and aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie
                    consumption. A study shows that a person burns 300 to 900kcal with an hour-long Zumba exercise. So,
                    if a person successfully burns 500 calories in each day's workout, then he/she can lose one pound of
                    weight in a week as one pound of fat contains about 3500 calories.

                    Because Zumba offers different options, proponents of the Zumba program claim that it is safe for
                    all ages, meaning that anyone from age 0 to 100 can participate in this form of aerobic exercise.
                    Some of the classes are specifically aimed at elderly people, to help them build strength, improve
                    motion and posture, and socialize.

                    Besides its high calorie burning benefit, Zumba can help lower the risk of heart disease, reduce
                    blood pressure and bad cholesterol, and increase good cholesterol
